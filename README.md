# Linear Algebra project

C project with the implementations of several algebraic algorithmic methods such as : <br/>

[-] The LU decomposition for a square matrix
[-] Solving a linear system using the LU decomposition
[-] The "naive" matrix inversion using the LU decomposition
[-] The inverse matrix using the Strassen's inversion algorithm with naive product
[-] Compute the inverse matrix but with the Strassen's multiplication algorithm
[-] A benchmark to compute time measurements over the different algorithms.

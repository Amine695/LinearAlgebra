# Linear Algebra project

C project with the implementations of several algebraic algorithmic methods such as : <br/>

- The LU decomposition for a square matrix <br/>
- Solving a linear system using the LU decomposition <br/>
- The "naive" matrix inversion using the LU decomposition <br/>
- The inverse matrix using the Strassen's inversion algorithm with naive product <br/>
- Compute the inverse matrix but with the Strassen's multiplication algorithm <br/>
- A benchmark to compute time measurements over the different algorithms. 


For more details, please see the doxygen documentation using the **index.html** file.
